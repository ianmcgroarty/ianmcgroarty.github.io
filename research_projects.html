This phenomenon is well understood in the industry, but has not been well documented in the academic literature, leading some to ask &ldquo;why do lenders make such an effort?&rdquo; I implemented a predictive margins analysis to isolate the controlled differences in account usage and profitability.&nbsp;</span></li>

The charts are exclusively based on the consumer credit panel data (CCP), a large panel dataset of 5% of US credit users provided by Equifax. With more than 1 billion rows and over 900 columns, this dataset requires careful planning to be managed effectively.&nbsp;</span></li>

            <li><u><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman";'>Project Description:</span></u><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman";'>&nbsp;With the rise of online banking, many wonder about the significance of brick-and-mortar bank branches. This project explores the dependence of the supply of credit on the availability of and proximity to bank branch locations. The analysis is based on spatial relations and the credit characteristics of consumers before and after nearby bank branch closures.&nbsp;</span></li>
            <li><u><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman";'>My contribution:</span></u><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman";'>&nbsp;I was responsible for merging the branch closure data and the consumer credit data. The branch data was developed for industry metrics not for research. To fit our needs, I geocoded the branch locations, and studied the how different banks and bank types reported their metrics. The event time analysis involved using R to identify spatial relationships between branch locations and census blocks.</span></li>
